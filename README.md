# A python implement of MDF
This version is only a rough implementation of linear echo cancellation in SPEEX, and it is not guaranteed to be completely consistent with the c/matlab version.
It's just for me to do some theoretical experiments, not the complete AEC part of SPEEX.

This python version of the mdf algorithm, which runs slowly and is not optimized.
